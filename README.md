"# AsteroidsGame" 

Created by Matt Stackpole in summer 2016 as part of Computer Graphics and Multimedia course.

Simple Asteroid game where ship follows the mouse. Fire with mouse clicks and see how long you can survive. This was an exercise in OOP with some abstraction and polymorphisms used. I also implemented my own basic collision detection.
